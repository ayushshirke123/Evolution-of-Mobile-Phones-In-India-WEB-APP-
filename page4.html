            <p>Foldable phones brought back the flip design but with flexible OLED screens. These devices offered larger displays in a compact form factor, improved multitasking, and new design innovations. Brands like Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola have pioneered this market.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Fold is an Android-based foldable smartphone developed by Samsung Electronics. Unveiled on February 20, 2019, it was released on September 6, 2019, in South Korea. The device is capable of being folded open to expose a 7.3-inch tablet-sized flexible display, while its front contains a smaller "cover" display, intended for accessing the device without opening it. With the announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip, Samsung's foldable phones were made part of the Galaxy Z series. This also retroactively applies to the Galaxy Fold.</p>
