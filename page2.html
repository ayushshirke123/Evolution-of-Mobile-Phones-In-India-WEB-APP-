            <p>Flip phones became highly popular during this period due to their compact design, durability, and improved battery life.</p>
            <p>They were also the first to introduce external displays, polyphonic ringtones, and early mobile internet (WAP browsing). Companies like Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung dominated this market.</p>
            <p>The StarTAC is a series of mobile phones released by Motorola starting in 1996. It is the successor of the MicroTAC, a semi-clamshell design first launched in 1989. Whereas the MicroTAC's flip folded down from below the keypad, the StarTAC folded up from above the display. The StarTAC was among the first mobile phones to gain widespread consumer adoption; approximately 60 million StarTACs were sold.</p>
            <p>The StarTAC was the first Clamshell/flip phone to gain widespread commercial use, although other less successful models had been in circulation as early as 1991,and an early precursor of this form factor, the Grillo, was designed as early as 1965.</p>
