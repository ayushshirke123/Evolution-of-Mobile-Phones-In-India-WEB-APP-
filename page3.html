          <p>This era marked the transition from basic phones to full touchscreen smartphones. Apple's iPhone (2007) set the standard for modern smartphones with multi-touch interfaces, powerful processors, app stores, and mobile internet capabilities. Android soon followed, offering more customization and variety.</p>
          <p>Development of the iPhone began in 2005 and continued in complete secrecy until its public unveiling at Macworld 2007. The device broke with prevailing mobile phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons and eschewing a stylus for its finger-friendly touch interface. The iPhone instead featured only a few physical buttons and a touch screen. It featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer, and it used continuous internet access and onboard processing to support features unrelated to voice communication. Its successor, the iPhone 3G, was announced on June 9, 2008.</p>
