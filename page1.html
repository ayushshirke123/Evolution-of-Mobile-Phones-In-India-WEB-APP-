            <h2>📜 Historical Significance:</h2>
            <p>Before the DynaTAC 8000X, mobile phones were mostly **car phones**, which required large external power sources. The **DynaTAC 8000X was the first truly portable mobile phone**, though it was still quite large by today’s standards.</p>
            
            <p>The development was led by **Martin Cooper**, a Motorola engineer, who made the first-ever mobile phone call on **April 3, 1973** using a prototype of the DynaTAC. He famously called his rival at **Bell Labs**, Dr. Joel Engel, to demonstrate the breakthrough.</p>
            
            <h2>📉 Evolution & Successors:</h2>
            <p>While groundbreaking, the **DynaTAC 8000X** was bulky and expensive. It was later succeeded by the **Motorola MicroTAC (1989)**, which introduced a **flip design**, and the **Motorola StarTAC (1996)**, the first **clamshell (flip) phone**.</p>
