            <p>AI-powered smartphones, such as the Google Pixel 8 and iPhone 15 Pro, introduced real-time language translation, advanced photography, and smart assistants.</p>
            <p>With AI becoming a key feature, modern smartphones now include AI-powered cameras, voice assistants, real-time language translation, and on-device AI processing. Features like AI-generated content, real-time call screening, and advanced computational photography have become mainstream.</p>
       <p>Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are elegantly designed with softer silhouettes, beautiful metal finishes and recycled materials.
        Pixel 8, with its contoured edges and smaller size than Pixel 7, feels great in your hand. It has a 6.2-inch Actua display, which gives you real-world clarity and is 42% brighter than Pixel 7’s display. Pixel 8 features satin metal finishes, a polished glass back and comes in Rose, Hazel and Obsidian.</p>
       <p>Pixel 8 Pro’s 6.7-inch Super Actua display features our brightest display yet. So even in direct sunlight, you’ll love how true-to-life your Ultra HDR images look. It also has a matte glass back with a polished aluminum frame and comes in three colors: Porcelain, Bay and Obsidian.
        And on the back of the Pixel 8 Pro, a new temperature sensor lets you quickly scan an object to get its temperature. Use it to check if your pan is hot enough to start cooking or if the milk in your baby’s bottle is at the right temperature. We’ve also submitted an application to the FDA, to enable Pixel’s Thermometer App to take your temperature and save it to Fitbit.</p>
